 		--> this contins only notes not programe

 		1.) ArraList -> uderlying dataStructure -> resizablearray
 		2.) LinkedList ->  uderlying dataStructure -> Doubly-LinkedList

 		we now see the difference based on various criteria : 

 		1.) Insertion :

 			for this LinkedList is more good bcoz: 

 				ArraList -> we need to traverse the elements for any kind of insertion(mid,end,start) ***it is like an array****

 				LinkedList -> we just add between the two nodes just point the node that is it

 		2.) Searching :

 			for this ArrayList is more good bcoz: 

 				ArraList -> we can access the particular index in ArraList 

 				LinkedList -> we need to traverse all the nodes

 		3.) memory :

 		   for this ArrayList is more good bcoz: 

 		   		ArraList -> it has only data

 		   		LinkedList -> it need space for both data and address of next node 

 		4.) DataAccess:

 			for this ArrayList is good bcoz :

 				ArrayList -> it has implements one interface that is randomaccess interface 
 						it is a marker interface (you know about it see the note book) so it provides fast data accessing capability  (vector also have this interface)

 				LinkedList -> we can access data here also but not here no interface or something but slow 

 		5.) Deletion:

 			for this LinkedList is more good bcoz: 

 				ArraList -> we need to traverse the elements for any kind of insertion(mid,end,start) ***it is like an array****

 				LinkedList -> we just delete node just point the node that is it
