		Set classes :
		
		1.) HashSet set.java

		2.) LinkedHashSet

		3.) TreeSet 
  
       interfaces also there we use class only we override features from interfaces see set.java

        4.) then see set2 folder (features)

        5.) navigable set it has few functionalites see here : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/navigableset-java-examples/


Important:
	HashSet and LinkedHashSet Should Implement below methods in user defined class
		Below methods are from Object class
		1. public boolean equals(Object o);
		2. public int hashCode();

	TreeSet Should Implement below method: in user defined class
		1. Either the user defined class should implement Comparable<>
		2. Or The Collection should passed with Comparator<>



if you See the each sections, we can connect the equals and hashCode statement studied in the chat GPT.
