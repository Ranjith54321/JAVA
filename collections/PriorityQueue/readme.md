  # Priority Queue : 

  	Inorder to implement priority queue you need to sort the input data manually using either comparable or comparator

  	then only you can use priority queue

  	here in Test1 :

  			using normal wrapper class (sorted using comparator interface)

  	In Test2 :

  			user defined class is sorted using comparable interface


   It works like heapify operation in Heap DataStrucures (Remember the Heap Sort data Structure)


   		Another type of Queue is there That is *Deque* see the details in GFG
