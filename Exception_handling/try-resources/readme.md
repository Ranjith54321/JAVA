 # try with resources :

 we can use try block wtih :

 	1.) try - catch

 	2.) try - final

 	3.) try - resourses

 	when you use resources you need to close it manually 

 		but when you use it inside the try block it automatically close it

 		example for resources :

 			Scanner , Connection , FileInputStream ect,..
